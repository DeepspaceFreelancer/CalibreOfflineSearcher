This is special project because it is targeted towards Android Api level 7, to run it on rooted Nook Simple Touch (Glowlight)
You need Eclipse to compile this.

Download and install: Eclipse for Android Developer

You need an older version of Android SDK:
http://dl-ssl.google.com/android/repository/tools_r19-windows.zip

The follow these steps:
1. Unzip the older Android SDK and set your Eclipse setting to it. This will give you errors and will offer you to open "Android SDK Manager".
2. Open "Android SDK Manager" from Eclipse and install 'Android SDK Tools' and 'Andoird SDK Platform-tools'. Once done, restart Eclipse.
3. After restart, open "Android SDK Manager" again and install the following:
* Android SDK Tools -> This is an upgrade.
* Android SDK Platform-tools -> This is an upgrade.
* Android SDK Build-tools newest version (Now this is: 19.1)
* Android 2.1 -> Everything from here.
* It will say to install Android 4.4.2, but you do need that. (You can choose it and do a compile for your new version).
4. Eclipse restart again.

After this you are ready to compile and run.
